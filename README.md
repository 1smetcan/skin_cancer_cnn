# Skin Cancer Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin images as either cancerous or healthy. The model is trained on datasets containing both types of images, enabling it to distinguish between skin cancer and non-cancerous conditions. Additionally, a web application has been created using Streamlit, which allows users to easily interact with the model. Through the application, users can upload their own images and receive real-time predictions, providing a user-friendly interface for evaluating potential skin issues.
